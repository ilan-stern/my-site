# Project
Build and break - Web Application.

# Goal
Advance my knowledge in the defensive and offensive aspects of web application security.

# Outline
I will be attempting to create a web application, starting at a very basic level, and attempting to find vulnerabilities in it. After exploiting the vulnerability, I will switch back to the defensive side and try patch this issue.

This will continue until I can no longer find a vulnerability.

In order to keep my progress trackable, I will segment this lab into different vulnerabilities. 

# Vulnerabilities to focus on:
- XSS
- SQL Injection
- Path Traversal
- Command Injection
- File Upload
- IDOR
- SSRF

It is likely that each of these vulnerabilities will be tested in a different site.

# Expected Outcome
- Learn how to exploit different types of web application vulnerabilities
- Observe what different levels of patches for each vulnerability looks like and how to implement them.
- Gain a deeper understanding of each vulnerability type.
- Develop an attacker mindset.
- Gain experience in real-world scenarios and best-practices
